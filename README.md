A simple and a little quirky program where you guess a random number the computer thought up and you get a response of higher or lower until guessed correctly with a small addition of the level up system which increases the upper range of the new number you're supposed to guess with each correct guess.

This is just a game made for fun and educational purposes only, made with Javascript/Node.js

You can give it a try here, just type node guesser.js in the shell tab and start guessing - https://replit.com/@KonImperator/GuessWhatNumber#guesser.js
